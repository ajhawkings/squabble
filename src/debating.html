      <h2>Why debate?</h2>
      <p>
        Debate is an integral part of our modern day life, in the form of both personal interactions and public affairs.
        It is a great way to express opposing viewpoints and, through respectful dialogue, learn to understand the
        perspective of someone with different ideas. Through a combination of precise instructions and illustrative
        examples, we can learn how to sharpen our debating skills and become more confident public speakers.
        <br><br>
        Firstly, one should first consider the topic of the debate and research it thoroughly to gain a better
        understanding of the subject. After gathering the necessary information, one should begin to form their opinion
        and create a clear and concise argument. It is important to analyse the evidence and identify any fallacies in
        the other side's argument. This will help to establish a stronger and more compelling case. Additionally, it is
        important to consider the various strategies that can be used to present the argument. For example, one can use
        data and statistics to support the argument or use rhetorical devices to make the argument more persuasive. To
        make the argument more effective, one should ensure to practice their argument beforehand and be prepared to
        answer any questions or objections that may arise. By following these steps, one can create an effective
        argumentative debate strategy.
        <br><br>
        Debating is an important skill to have as it enables individuals to effectively present their opinions and
        opinions of others in a clear, organised, and logical way. In order to create an effective argument while
        debating, it is important to understand the structure of a debate and the most effective way of presenting
        arguments. The first step in creating an effective argument is to identify the audience and the purpose of the
        debate. Knowing the audience will help determine the language and the tone to be used in the debate, and will
        provide insight into the type of arguments that should be presented. The second step is to understand the
        structure of the debate. This includes understanding what information should be included in the introduction,
        the body of the argument, and the conclusion. Once the structure is understood, it is important to research and
        collect evidence to support the argument. It is important to provide evidence that is reliable and relevant to
        the argument. Once the evidence is collected, it is important to organise the argument in a logical and
        organised manner. Finally, it is important to practice presenting the argument in a clear and concise way. By
        following these steps, individuals can create an effective argument when debating.
        <br><br>
        The key of effective preparation for a debate is to understand the format and the material that will be
        discussed. According to D Ridley, “debates are verbal jousts between two or more teams, each defending a
        particular point of view”. Therefore, it is essential to research both sides of the argument and understand the
        evidence that supports each side. Once the research is complete, it is important to develop an argument that is
        clear, concise, and persuasive. This process involves breaking down the research into individual points and
        arguments, outlining them in a logical sequence, and then using this information to create a well-informed and
        effective argument. Additionally, it is important to practice the argument frequently to become familiar with
        the material.
        <br><br>
        Finally, it is beneficial to research the other teams' arguments to gain insight into their strategies and to
        prepare rebuttals. By following these steps, a person can be adequately prepared for a debate.
        Debates can be intimidating, but with the right preparation and practice, anyone can take part in a successful
        debate. By following the step-by-step tutorial, you'll be able to better understand and participate in debates
        while also raising your own sense of confidence.
        <br><br>
        Ultimately, debates are a positive way to learn more about yourself, others, and a variety of topics. So don't
        be afraid to take the leap and take advantage of the invaluable experience that debates have to offer.
