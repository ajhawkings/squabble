      <h2>We are Squabble, a Young Enterprise team</h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of 9 students representing <a href="https://kcs.org.uk">King's College School</a> at the UK's
        <a href="https://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/">Young Enterprise</a> competition in 2023<br>
        We've come up with an idea for a game that's both fun and educational. It's called Squabble!<br>
        It encourages people to all ages to think about an issue and debate with other characters in the game.<br>
        But... there's a twist. You're debating as a fictional character and you have to argue it from their point of
        view.<br>
        You see - it really is both fun and educational... That's why it's so <u>seriously</u> <i>silly</i>!<br><br>

      <h2>Tips for speaking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Stay on topic:</b> You have limited time to be convincing, so don't waste valuable seconds on something
          off-topic</li>
        <li><b>Speak clearly and don't rush:</b> Many new debaters mumble or rush what they're saying — don't fall into
          this trap</li>
        <li><b>Be confident:</b> No-one can be perfect at something they're new to, so don't be afraid to to take risks
          and put yourself out there</li>
        <li><b>Think about your body language:</b> Speaking is about selling your viewpoint to the audience, so body
          language can have a very large impact</li>
        <li><b>Listen:</b> To be a good speaker, it's important to have a good understanding of counterarguments that
          invalidate your stance — so make sure you are respectful and listen carefully to the other players</li>
        <li><b>Anticipate your opponent's questions:</b> This can be a very effective tactic because it allows you extra
          time to come up with convincing arguments, and you can use this to make your opponents' views seem less valid
        </li>
        <li><b>Take breaks:</b> Stop and take a breath when needed - don't be afraid to pause and gather your thoughts.
        </li>
        <li><b>Have fun:</b> Remember, this is a game! It's designed to both improve your communication skills AND allow
          you to enjoy yourself</li>

      <h2>Why debate?</h2>
      <p>Debate is an integral part of our modern day life, in the form of both personal interactions and public
        affairs. It is a great way to express opposing viewpoints and, through respectful dialogue, learn to
        understand
        the perspective of someone with different ideas. Through a combination of precise instructions and
        illustrative
        examples, we can learn how to sharpen our debating skills and become more confident public speakers.&nbsp;
